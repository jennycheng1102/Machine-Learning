1.local learning of graduation rate
colleges are demanded to do better in student's graduation,so many schools are asking big data how to do that.
The research is conducted basing on thesis 《Local minimax Learning of Functions With Best Finite Sample Estimation》
thesis URL http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5319754/
apply four algorithms in the thesis to the colledge graduation data
weighted least squares
rotation invariant version:assume the setting of an approximate linear target function in V but has certain bound on its oscillation V

2.finding donars
finding people who are more likely to make donors
Apply machine learning algrithms to the data set to find people whose salary is more than 50K from the data collected from US charity organization

3.STATS202
build classification model to predict 'relevance'
