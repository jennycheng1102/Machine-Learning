# local-learning-python
Based on thesis 《Local minimax Learning of Functions With Best Finite Sample Estimation》
thesis URL http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5319754/
apply four algorithms in the thesis to the colledge graduation data
1. weighted least squares
2.rotation invariant version:assume the setting of an approximate linear target function in V but has certain bound on its oscillation V
